1. Need to handle duplicate Artist/Title
2. Need to record the date that the song was added to the db. Then the user can sort by added today/week/month etc. Handled by created_at
3. Allow for user tags - playlists?
4. Save path and filename separately - use cases: browse by folders or n folder hierarchy
5. Save number of times a song is played to allow search by most played
